# The Alternative Prompts & Buttons Project (The APB Project)

The APB Project is an attempt to bring as many alternative button prompts to as many games as possible via modding. This includes emulated and native PC titles. 

Supported prompts will vary on a game-to-game basis. A full release will be expected to include icons for Steam Deck, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox 360, PS4/PS5, and Nintendo Switch at the minimum.
